1. Pour glue into bowl and add baking soda to middle. Then pour contact solution on top.
2. Stir ingredients together until you can no longer stir.
 There will still be liquid in the bowl. 
Mix the liquid into the slime with your hands until it has all worked 
in (about 1-2 minutes) 
and is no longer sticky. 
It will not be sticky when it is all worked in.
3. Wash hands, then you’re ready to play with your slime! Store in a plastic container with a lid or zip top bag.
